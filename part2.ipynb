    "In part III., we will begin by addressing a rather general question: under what conditions does synchronization occur in the Kuramoto model? We will find that in order to address this question, we need some quantitative measurement of synchronization, which we will call the order parameter. By examining the behavior of the order parameter at different coupling strengths, we can begin to understand the conditions under which synchronization occurs in the Kuramoto model. But perhaps more significantly, we will encounter a phase transition in the order parameter, which is a very deep concept that connects to may other areas of physics.\n",

    "For our values of $K$, it's often a good choice to choose a range of values that we want to consider, and then pick evenly spaced values throughout this range. In this context, a decent range of values to try is $K$ between $0.00$ and $1.00$. If we pick a spacing of $0.01$, then we will have $101$ different values of $K$ to consider: $K = 0.00, 0.01, 0.02, \\ldots, 0.99, 1.00$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we loop over all the values of $K$. For each value of $K$, we run a Kuramoto model simulation, and then calculate the long run value of the order parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, how should we display our data? A illustrative way of doing this is to create a plot with values of $K$ on the horizontal axis, and values of long-run $r$ on the vertical axis. Such a plot is known as a bifurcation diagram.\n",

    "**Task:** Create a bifurcation diagram for $N=512$ Kuramoto oscillators with $K$ ranging from $0.00$ to $1.00$ with a spacing of $0.01$. As you've done previously, the natural frequencies should be drawn from a normal distribution with mean $1$ and standard deviation $0.1$. You should use the same timestep for the simulation as you have previously, but use a simulation length of $5000$ timesteps now (so the oscillators have time to settle into their long-run behavior). The long-run order parameter should be estimated by taking the average of order parameter over the last $20%$ of the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "(*Hint:* Use Numpy's `linspace` function to create an array of evenly spaced values of $K$ for you to loop over.)\n",
    "\n",
    "(*Hint 2:* Use Matplotlib's `plt.scatter` function to plot data points.)\n",
    "\n",
    "(*Hint 3:* Since you are doing $101$ separate simulations, it may take your computer a while to produce a complete bifurcation diagram, depending on your computer, but it shouldn't take more than half and hour.)"

Does the long-run $r$ have an increasing or decreasing relationship with $K$, or neither? If there is a relationship, does it appear linear or non-linear? Are there ranges of values of $K$ where adjusting $K$ has limited effect on the long-run $r$? How about ranges of values of $K$ where adjusting $K$ has a large impact on the long-run $r$?"

    "A phase transition is a sudden change in the behavior or properties of a system that occurs at a particular critical point or threshold.

For instance, when liquid water is cooled past 0 degrees Celcius, it suddenly becomes more ordered, forming a crystal structure and becoming ice.\n",

This phase transition occurs at a critical coupling strength of about $K \\approx 0.16$.\n",

As the coupling strength increases, the oscillators become more strongly influenced by each other and begin to synchronize.
