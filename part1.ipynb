    "Create a simulation of the Kuramoto model in Python, and investigate the conditions under which spontaneous synchronization occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "Collective synchronization is a remarkable effect observed in many diverse areas of our world. Synchronization can appear between living things, such as in the [flocking behavior of birds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dskCpuxqtI) and fish, the [synchronized flashing of some types of fireflies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BOjTMkyfIA), and even the synchronized pulsing of the cells of your heart to pump blood. But synchronization doesnâ€™t just occur between living things: it can also occur [between pendulums](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T58lGKREubo), in the motion of planetary bodies, and in [chemical reactions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpyKSRo8Iec).\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the many phenomena of collective synchronization, a mathematical model called the Kuramoto model has been studied in the research community. In the Kuramoto model, a collection of individual oscillators is considered, where each oscillator wants to oscillate at its own natural frequency. Each oscillator is often represented as a point on a circle, and oscillations are shown by the point moving around the circle. However, each oscillator is also influenced by the motion of the other oscillators, being pushed and pulled in a specific way as expressed by a set of equations called the Kuramoto equations. Due to these interactions, the Kuramoto model exhibits collective behavior. Although it is a relatively simple model without the diverse nuances of real-life spontaneous synchronization, study of the Kuramoto model has still revealed much insight into spontaneous synchronization that can be generalized to many areas, and research related to the Kuramoto model is ongoing.\n",
    "\n",
    "***In this challenge question, you will use Python to create a computational simulation of the Kuramoto model.*** The first objective of the challenge question is to observe spontaneous synchronization in the results of your simulation. If you achieve this, you can then begin exploring the conditions under which synchronization occurs in the Kuramoto model, changing for example the coupling strength between the oscillators, or the underlying interaction network. Such investigation may lead you to encounters with topics such as phase transitions, network science, and universality.\n",

This info is intended to be a reference for the challenge question, but you are also encouraged to seek information through your own research via the internet. *Feel free to get started on Part II. before fully reading all of this section, and refer back to this Part I. as needed.*\n",

    "Part II. is where you will create a numerical simulation of the Kuramoto model in guided steps. You will be tasked with completing or creating pieces of Python code, according to the guiding information. The tasks will start out relatively straightforward at first, but will become progressively more open-ended. As you progress through the notebook, you will visualize results using animations. You will also be asked to write brief reflections about what you observe. The reflections may also ask you to modify certain parts of your code and record what happens.\n",

    "Parts III. and IV. are contained in separate notebooks and focus on phase transitions and network effects in the Kuramoto model, respectively. These parts still consist of guided tasks, but the tasks are significantly more open-ended."

    "A differential equation is an equation that describes the rate of change of a variable. Since derivatives tell you the rate of change of a variable, differential equations involve derivatives. An example of a simple ordinary differential equation is $\\frac{dx}{dt} = x$.

    "If we have a differential equation (or multiple coupled differential equations), how can we solve it? There are a vast array of techniques for solving differential equations that apply in many different scenarios. Here, we will use a commonly used technique called Euler's method to approximate a solution to differential equations. Euler's method is convenient because of its relative simplicity and how readily it can be adapted to computational simulations, and it happens to work relatively well for the Kuramoto equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we have a single differential equation $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} = f(x)$, where $f$ is some function, and we know that when $t=t_0$, $x = x_0$. If we want to estimate the value of $x$ at a time $t_1$ shortly after $t_0$, we can use the following steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate $f(x_0)$. This then equals $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t}$, the rate of change of $x$, at and just after $t_0$.\n",
    "2. Assume the rate of change of $x$ is nearly constant between $t_0$ and $t_1$. Then the graph of $x$ vs. $t$ looks nearly like a line with slope $f(x_0)$, and using the equation for a line we estimate that $x(t_1) = x(t_0) + f(x_0) * (t_1 - t_0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, say we want to estimate the value of $x$ at a time $t_2$ shortly after $t_1$. We can repeat the above steps, but starting from $t_1$ instead of $t_0$. By repeating this process for an arbitrarily long time, we can make an estimate of $x$ for $t$ arbitrarily long after $t_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using Euler's method in a computational setting, time is often divided into equal-sized increments: We set a \"timestep\" $\\Delta t$, let $t_0 = 0$, and let $t_1 = 1 * \\Delta t$, $t_2 = 2 * \\Delta t$, $t_3 = 3 * \\Delta t$, $\\ldots$. In this case of evenly spaced timesteps, Euler's method then says that \n",

    "If we know the value of $x(t_0)$, we can then use this equation to estimate the value of $x(t_1)$, then use that to estimate the value of $x(t_2)$, and on and on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, lets relate this back to the $N$ coupled Kuramoto differential equations. Focusing on the $i$ th oscillator, which obeys $\\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\theta_i}{\\mathrm{d} t} = \\omega_i + \\frac{K}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\sin(\\theta_j - \\theta_i)$, we can see that by applying Euler's method,\n",

    "Although the equation may look a bit long, the key insight is that if we know all of the $\\theta_i$ s at timestep $t_{n-1}$, then we can figure out an approximation for all of the $\\theta_i$ s at timestep $t_n$. This method is how we will create our simulations of the Kuramoto model, although we will build up to the full simulation in steps.\n",

Arrays are used to store and manipulate large sets of data in a consistent and efficient manner.
